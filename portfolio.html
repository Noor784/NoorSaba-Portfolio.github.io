          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and organize the content on a web page. 
            It uses various tags to define the different elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and links.
            HTML elements are hierarchical, which means that they can be nested inside each other to create a tree-like 
            structure of the content on the web page.
            This hierarchical structure is called the DOM (Document Object Model), and it is used by the web browser to render the web page.</p>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
            CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.
             It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. </p>

             that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular 
             choice for enterprise-level applications.</p>

        <p>Manual Testing is the Software Testing Technique that is carried out using the functions and features of an application. 
          In manual testing, a tester carries out tests on the software by following a set of predefined test cases. 
          In this testing, testers make test cases for the codes and test the software and give the final report about that software. 
          Manual testing is time-consuming testing because it is done by humans and there is a chance of human errors. </p>
